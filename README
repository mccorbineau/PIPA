DESCRIPTION:

This code allows to perform two different image processing applications both formulated as the mini-
mization of a convex objective function under convex constraints. In both cases the minimization 
process is based on a Proximal Interior Point Algorithm (PIPA) including a variable metric.

Hyperspectral unmixing
======================
The inverse problem is formulated as follows: minimize_X  0.5*||Y-S*X||_2^2 + reg*||W*X||_{1,detail}
                                              subject to  for every pixel p, sum_i(X_{i,p})<=1
                                                          X >=0
Where: Y is the data
       X is the abundance map (proportion of every material in every pixel)
       S is the library of the spectral signatures of the different materials for various spectral 
       bands reg is a regularization parameter
       W is an orthogonal wavelet transform
       ||W.||_{1,detail} is the l1 norm of the detail wavelet coefficients 
       X_{i,p} is the abundance of material i in pixel p

Joint decomposition and reconstruction of tomographic data
==========================================================
The decomposition is done by identifying a geometry component (piecewise constant) and a texture 
(locally fast-varying elements).
The problem is formulated as follows: minimize_(x^t,x^g)  0.5*||F*x^t||_2^2 + alpha*TV(x^g)
                                              subject to  -chi<= H*(x^t+x^g)-y <= chi
                                                          xmin <= x^t+x^g <= xmax
                                                          -xmax/3 <= xt <= xmax/3
Where: F=I_N-Delta and Delta is the Laplacian edge detection operator
       TV is the total variation seminorm
       alpha is a regularization parameter
       x^t and x^g are the texture and the geometry, respectively
       H is the observation operator (radon transform)
       y is the tomographic data
       chi is the measurement uncertainty

This toolbox consists of 5 subfolders:
1) data_geo_text: data for the geometry-texture decomposition application, contains the CT operator 
                  H and data for two real images (glass and agaricus)
1) data_hyperspectral: data for the hyperspectral unmixing application (Urban dataset)
2) functions_geo_text: decomposition/reconstruction programs
4) functions_hyperspectral: hyperspectral unmixing programs
3) TOOLBOX_DWTRed_Frame: wavelet toolbox provided by Caroline Chaux (more information within this 
                         folder)
